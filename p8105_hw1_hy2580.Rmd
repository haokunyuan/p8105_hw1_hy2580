## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Problem 1

Create data frame:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
vec_numeric = runif(10,0,5)
vec_logical = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)
vec_char = c("It", "is", "hard", "to", "think", "of", "so", "many", "different", "characters")
vec_factor = factor(c("female", "female", "female","female", "female", "male", "male", "male", "male", "male"))

tibble(vec_numeric, vec_logical, vec_char, vec_factor)
```

Take mean of the variable:

```{r}
mean_numeric = mean(vec_numeric)
mean_logical = mean(vec_logical)
mean_char = mean(vec_char)
mean_factor = mean(vec_factor)
```
